## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

I love playing games, so I decided to build a site to play them at.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1. A code editor
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
3. A browser
4. A terminal application, such as [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
5. A package manager, such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installing

1. Download the repo to the directory of your choice, by either clicking the download button, or run `git clone https://github.com/Sudolphus/sudo-games-site.git`
2. Open with the code editor of your choice, and edit to your heart's content.
3. To run the code, navigate into the root directory with your terminal application and acquire the packages with `npm install` or `yarn install`, depending on your package manager.
4. A development build can be started with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`, which can them be viewed in your browser at `localhost:3000`
5. A production build can be created with `npm run build` or `yarn build`, which will create a public/ folder with optimized code bundled by webpack.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Once the system is installed and online, it should be as easy as opening the page in your browser.
